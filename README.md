Project Title: Restaurant Reservation System Documentation

Description:
Completed during the EEI4267-Requirement Engineering subject course in my second year of university, I led the conceptualization and documentation efforts for a cutting-edge Restaurant Reservation System. Collaborating with a dynamic team, we utilized visualization tools to create comprehensive architectural diagrams and user interfaces, ensuring a seamless and visually intuitive experience for users.

Key Contributions:
1. Requirements Gathering:
   - Led the requirements gathering phase, utilizing visualization tools to articulate the project scope, assumptions, and deployment strategies in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.

2. Architecture and Design:
   - Applied visualization tools to craft Context Data Flow Diagrams, contributing to the overall architecture and design of the system.

3. Implementation of Functional Requirements:
   - Actively involved in the planning and coordination of the implementation of functional requirements, ensuring alignment with the visual representations created.

4. User Interface Design:
   - Designed user interfaces to enhance the user experience and streamline the table reservation process.

5. Quality Assurance:
   - Contributed to quality assurance efforts by visually mapping out testing scopes and criticality guidelines, ensuring the reliability of the system.

Outcome:
Successfully delivered a comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document as part of the EEI4267-Requirement Engineering subject course. This project has enriched my skills in project management, requirements analysis, system design, and effective communication within a team.

Technologies and Tools:
Draw.io

This project showcases my commitment to excellence and my ability to contribute to projects, particularly within the context of the requirement engineering subject course.
